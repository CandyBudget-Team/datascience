# datascience
This is the playground for doing datascience: data viz, selection, cleaning, model building to be added to the backend as MongoDB Models and Flask Endpoints utilities.

This is where we go into the weeds:
We need to answer some questions:
- what is the youngest age.
- extract families where difference of age is at least 15 years in the account branch (primary and AUs)
- Select a family for initial study for saving model
- Define the DB models
- Define the logic
- Define the utilities

The sudy proposal:
- determine the a budget for the whole family based on the monthly spendings and payments.
- replay the whole process to validate.
- craft the logic and models
- replay with the logic and model.
- validate the ranking and features
- test if the model is flexible for adding more complexity with the rewards.

Run the study on more families (25%):
- Split the results in the teams
- Validate it

Create a new family:
- Study how it is doing
- Validate the models and logic

Integrate the model and logic to the DB and utilities for the API.

Link the client to the API
Test and fix the link to see saving model first and then rewards model

Scale the model complexity to enrish the parents views.
